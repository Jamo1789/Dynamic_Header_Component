# Dynamic_Header_Component

Description: One global component for getting the page header out of the way of content. Once user scrolls down, header will get out of the way and comes back to check on you
once user scrolls up. This way you keep the page navigation constantly up close but it doesn't bother the other content.

You can use this component by just sourcing it directly from git. Using this option, include following script at the end of body tag:
<script src="https://jamo1789.github.io/Dynamic_Header_Component/Dynamic_header.js"></script>

..or download the js-file and include it on the page.

Prerequisites:

1. This component is designed to work for only one header element on the page. If page header is made with a div-tag, this component is useless.
2. This works for sticky headers mainly. If your header remains at absolute location, this component doesn't really bring any benefits.
